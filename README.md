# Portifoly
- That is the Portifoly of things that I am learning.
- I dont know exactly where I will arive, but lets go there.
- I started 25/11/2025 with this challenge.
  
# I am using the Datacamp for start my studies of Data Analist:
## Introduction to SQL (done):
### - What is SQL (Structurad Query Language), database (store data reliably, retrieve information efficiently, and manipulate data systematically), structure of rows and column (individual entity and specific attribute or properties);
### SELECT tells SQL which columns to retrieve, * means "get all columns" from the table, FROM products tells SQL which table to get the data from, ; marks the end of your statement, ORDER BY rating sorts the results by the rating column in ascending order (lowest to highest), DESC sort in descending order, LIMIT restricts how many rows are returned (Limiting results is essential practice in SQL);
### The DISTINCT keyword is placed immediately after SELECT. It identifies and returns only the unique values from the category column. 
### The AS keyword assigns a new display name to the column that comes before it. The alias appears in your results only—it doesn't change the actual column name in the database (This makes your output clearer and more professional);
### Database servers store and manage databases, while database clients connect to servers and send queries;
### 1. Web Applications: Browser-based tools provided by cloud databases. Examples: BigQuery Console, Snowflake Web UI. Easy to start, nothing to install. 2. Desktop Applications: Software you install on your computer with a friendly interface. Examples: DBeaver, TablePlus, DataGrip;
### To connect, you need to provide: Server address: Where the database lives (URL or IP address), Username: Your account name, Password: Your account password, Database name: Which specific database to use;

## SQL Intermediate (doing now):
### COUNT() function used to count the amount of data. Can be used with AS, and *;
### Leitura do (Estilo)[https://www.sqlstyle.guide/pt-br/];
### ; - Indica o fim de uma consulta;
### WHERE - as a oparator. After FROM and before LIMIT;
### Use of <,>,<=,>=,<>, =;
### Use of OR, AND , BETWEEN;
### Use of LIKE, NOT LIKE and IN. Use of joker % (means zero, one or more caracters) and _ (means only one caracter);
### NULL values. IS NULL or IS NOT NULL/
